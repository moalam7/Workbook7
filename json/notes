JSON - JavaScript Object Notation - is a standard format for repreenting text-based structured data.

- Objects are stored within curly braces
- Data is in property / value pairs
- Based on JS object syntax

Example:
{
"employeeID" : "3",
"name" : "Ian",
"jobTitle" : "Stock Broker",
"payRate" : 108.17
};

JSON values must be one of the following data types:

- string
- number
- Boolean
- array
- null
- another JSON object

Another Example:
{
"department" : "Texas State College",
"location" : "Joshua Campus",
"faculty" : [
{
"name" : "Dr. Siddalee Grace",
"department" : "Marketing",
"rank" : "Associate Professor",
"phone" : "(979)555-1212"
},
{
"name" : "Dr. Pursalane Faye",
"department" : "Library Science",
"rank" : "Professor",
"phone" : "(979)555-1213"
}
{
"name" : "Dr. Zephaniah Hughes",
"department" : "Engineering Tech",
"rank" : "Assistant Professor",
"phone" : "(979)555-1214"
}
]
}

JSON is often used for transmitting data across web servers

To transmit JSON data over a netowrk, you must convert it to a string

- This is usually known as stringification

Then, when you want to access stringified JSON data, you must convert it back to a native JS Object

- This is usually known as parsing

The following JS methods will help you with these tasks:

- JSON.stringify()
- JSON.parse()
