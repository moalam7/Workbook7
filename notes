-----------------------MODULE 1 - JSON --------------------------------
JSON - JavaScript Object Notation - is a standard format for repreenting text-based structured data.

- Objects are stored within curly braces
- Data is in property / value pairs
- Based on JS object syntax

Example:
{
"employeeID" : "3",
"name" : "Ian",
"jobTitle" : "Stock Broker",
"payRate" : 108.17
};

JSON values must be one of the following data types:

- string
- number
- Boolean
- array
- null
- another JSON object

Another Example:
{
"department" : "Texas State College",
"location" : "Joshua Campus",
"faculty" : [
{
"name" : "Dr. Siddalee Grace",
"department" : "Marketing",
"rank" : "Associate Professor",
"phone" : "(979)555-1212"
},
{
"name" : "Dr. Pursalane Faye",
"department" : "Library Science",
"rank" : "Professor",
"phone" : "(979)555-1213"
}
{
"name" : "Dr. Zephaniah Hughes",
"department" : "Engineering Tech",
"rank" : "Assistant Professor",
"phone" : "(979)555-1214"
}
]
}

JSON is often used for transmitting data across web servers

To transmit JSON data over a netowrk, you must convert it to a string

- This is usually known as stringification

Then, when you want to access stringified JSON data, you must convert it back to a native JS Object

- This is usually known as parsing

The following JS methods will help you with these tasks:

- JSON.stringify()
- JSON.parse()

              STRINGIFYING JSON

Use JSON.stringify() to create JSON string from a JS Object

- You will see this when we start calling server-side methids to retrieve data from or pass data to a REST API
  EXAMPLE:

let job = {
title : "Web Designer",
startDate : "October 2022",
company : "AT&T",
minSalary : 52000,
maxSalary : 86000
};
let str = JSON.stringify(job);
console.log(str);

STRING CONTAINS - OUTPUT
{
"title" : "Web Designer",
"startDate" : "October 2022",
"company" : "AT&T",
"minSalary" : 52000,
"maxSalary" : 86000
}

You can provide a filter to stringify() so that it only includes the properties specified

- Filter is specified as a JS array of quoted property names surrounded by square brackets
  EXAMPLE:

let job = {
title : "Web Designer",
startDate : "October 2022",
company : "AT&T",
minSalary : 52000,
maxSalary : 86000
};
let filter = ["title", "company"];
let str = JSON.stringify(job, filter);

let str = JSON.stringify(job);
console.log(str);
// only the title and company properties will be in
// the string

STRING CONTAINS - OUTPUT
{
"title" : "Web Designer",
"company" : "AT&T"
}

              PARSING JSON

Use JSON.parse() to convert JSON string back into a JS Object

- If the string is not valid JSON, an error is generated
- ES6 allows multilining strings if they are surrounded by back ticks (`)
  EXAMPLE:

let str = `{"title" : "Web Designer",
 "startDate" : "October 2022",
 "company" : "AT&T",
 "minSalary" : 52000,
 "maxSalary" : 86000
 }`;

let job = JSON.parse(str);
console.log(job.title);
console.log(job.company);

-----------------------MODULE 2 - AJAX AND REST APIS ------------------------
AJAX is a technique that allows JS to send asynchronous HTTP requests(in the background) to a web server that manages back-end data

- AJAX stands for Asynchronous JS And XML

AJAX lets us FETCH data based on the user interactions and then dynamically update the page
Example? Just think about how Google's search page works

- As you type characters, the list of suggestions is automatically updated without any page flicekr

AJAX can also be used to SEND data to a web server that manages back-end data

Even though the X in AJAX stands for XML, it can be uised to send.recieve both XML and JSON data

EXAMPLES OF AJAX:

- Autocomplete: Google Search Bar
- Real-time Updates - ESPN Sports Page
- Chat Window, E-Commerce site, uses AJAX 2 ways, sends messages to web server +\_ fetches live agent's responses from web server

              REST APIS

  An API is a collection of functions that allow clients and servers to exchange specific information
  API stands for Application Programming Interface

The API lives on a server

- A client makes calls to it
- The API returns information

REST - REST is a set of rules about HOW developers create APIs on a web server

One of the REST rules is that you get a specific piece of data(or resource) when you communicate with a specific URL(or endpoint)

- REST expects HTTP requests to be sent to a specific URL
- The data returned is included in an HTTP response

Another REST rule is that the HTTP method of the request tells the endpoint what action you want it to perform

- The HTTP GET verb means you are requesting a resources
- The HTTP POST verb means you are sending a new resource for insertion
- The HTTP PUT verb means you are sending updates to a resource
- The HTTP DELETE verb means you are requesting a resource be deleted

One reason REST is popular is that it adds almost no overhead to the HTTP request/response model

REST APIs have very unique URLS with specific meanings
EXAMPLE:
Gets customers gets ALL customers
GET / api / customers

Gets customer 101
GET / api / customers / 101

Inserts accompanying body data into the customer data store
POST / api / customers

Updates customer data store from accompanying body data
PUT / api / customers

Deletes customer 101
DELETE / api / customers / 101

\*\*IMPORTANT: You do not have to design the URL with the /api segment

- However, many API developers use that convention

          HTTP Requests and HTTP Responses

An HTTP request contains 4 pieces of information:

- The endpoint(URL)
- The HTTP method
- Series of HTTP headers
- The data(message body)

An HTTP response contains 3 pieces of information:

- Status line
- Series of HTTP headers
- Returned data(message body)

HTTP request and response headers are strings that specify additional information

- Request headers provide information to the server
  - Headers often provide authentication information and information about the body content type and encoding
- Response headers provide information to the client
  - Headers might include information such as body content type or content encoding

Requests and responses also contain a body

- The request body carries POST and PUT data to the server
- The response body carries return information from the server

        HTTP Status Codes

  HTTP response also includes a 3-digit # that specifies an HTTP status code

- 100-199 are information messages
- 200-299 represent success codes
- 300-399 are redirection codes that mean further action is required
- 400-499 means the request contained incorrect information or could not be processed
- 500-599 means there was a server error

Programmers can use the status code to determine whether the request was successful and whether response data is available

Common response codes include:

- 200 OK : The request is OK
- 201 Created: The request is complete and a new resource was created
- 400 Bad Request: The server did not understand the request
- 404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested URL
- 500 Internal Server Error: The request was not completed; the serveer met an unexpected condition

          jsonplaceholder: A QUICK EXAMPLE

  REST API named at the following URL that often used as learning tool:
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Comes with a set of 6 common resources:

- /posts 100 posts
- /users 10 users
- /comments 500 comments
- /albums 100 albums
- /photos 5000 photos
- /todos 200 todos

You can send an HTTP GET request such as:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1

It will return a JSON object:
Example:
{
"userId": 1,
"id": 1,
"title": "delectus aut autem",
"completed": false
}

GET /users:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

GET /users/3 --> users where ID = 3:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/3
